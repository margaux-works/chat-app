## Deployment / Setup the app

Follow these steps to set up and run your chat app.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following software installed on your development machine:

- Node.js (version 16.x or later recommended)
- Expo CLI
- Android Studio (for running on Android emulator)
- Xcode (for running on iOS, macOS only)
- Firebase Project (for real-time messaging and media storage)

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-demo.git
cd chat-demo
```

### 2. Install the Expo CLI

You can install Expo CLI globally by running:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install all necessary packages:

```
npm install
```

### 4. Setup Firebase

1. Create a new project in Firebase Console.
2. Enable Firestore and Firebase Storage for your project.
3. Copy the Firebase configuration from your project and replace the values in the firebaseConfig object inside App.js.

Your firebaseConfig will look something like this:

```
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

### 5. Running the App on Emulator or Device

After setting up Firebase, you can run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

- **Android Emulator**: Run the following command to start the app in Android Studio's emulator:

```
npm run android

```

- **iOS Emulator (macOS only)**: Run the following command to start the app in Xcode's iOS simulator:

### Firebase Rules

Make sure to set the proper rules for Firestore and Storage in the Firebase Console:

- **Firestore Rules**:

```
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

- **Storage Rules**:

```
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```
